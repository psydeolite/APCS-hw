Overall, pretty clear and straightforward. An issue in the Base class setName function (line 23): there's no instance variable called "n"? 
Also I noticed that you didn't specify access for some instance variables, like Health in SunMaker.java and sunCount in Gui.java. In Gui.java, sunCount is public (21), but you also have a getSunCount function (119). The getter function would make more sense if the variable was private, which is recommended anyway. 
Documentation is needed but at this point there isn't much to document.
I can see there's a lot of testing going on and the functional code deals with setting up the visual stuff. I'd recommend you start working on the game functionality itself soon.
Good luck~
